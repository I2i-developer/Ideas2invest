        definition:
            "Corporate Fixed Deposits are debt instruments issued directly by companies (commonly NBFCs, housing finance companies, or large corporates) to raise funds from the public or selected investors. They function like bank fixed deposits — you lend money to the issuer for a fixed tenure in return for a pre-agreed interest rate — but are issued by corporates instead of banks. Corporate FDs typically offer higher interest rates than bank FDs to compensate for increased credit risk. While they provide predictable cash flows and flexible payout options, they are not covered by the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) protection that bank deposits enjoy, so the safety of principal and interest depends on the issuer’s credit quality and financial strength.",

        howToChoose:

Prefer issuers with stable cash flows, strong promoters, and transparent disclosures. Compare effective yields (annualised rate, compounding frequency), premature withdrawal rules and penalties, tenure alignment with your liquidity needs, and whether the deposit is secured or unsecured. Understand tax treatment (interest is taxable and may attract TDS) and confirm the process for claims/repayment. Avoid over-concentrating in one issuer and consider laddering deposits across maturities and issuers to manage liquidity and reinvestment risk.",
